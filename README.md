# Introduction
This project was born out of my desire to learn more about [analysis of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) and also learn the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

Now I plan to use this project to implement the same algorithms (and also other programming patterns) in different programming languages.

The list of programming languages I wish to implement for:
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- C/C++
- LISP or [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
- Raw Assembly
- C#
